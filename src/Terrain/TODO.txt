fix one path
    should be renamed unit_path
    should be a glorified boolean 
    saves two things
        1) is the path open
        2) in what direction is the path
            ie. up or down, horizontal, diagonal, up and over, or up and diagonal.
        this should take 6 bits total.
    this way the path can be easily converted to a "has a" functionality. the unit path will test if all its paths are compatible with the given type.
