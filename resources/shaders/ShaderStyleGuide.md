# Variables

`snake_case`

# Program Names

`PascalCase`

I don't know where these would be used.

These are used to descriptions and are in `Title Case`

# Program IDs

`program_mane_PID_`

# Uniforms

string names sent to opengl

`snake_case`

uniform ids

`uniform_name_{program}_UID_` The program should only be put if
there are multiple programs in the same class.
