FunGame License
Version 0.1.0

Preamble

A video game is a multi-media artwork. The software and the game art must necessarily be
licensed under different license agreements. There are five general parts 1) the software
2) the game art 3) the game play 4) promotional material, and 5) additional artwork. Each
is licensed under a different license. (At this point only the first three exist). 

In the spirit of GNU the software is free as in beer and free as in speech. You are free
to use the artwork for your own personal use. You may not however modify and reproduce
the artwork.

This license is not fixed. As it stands this license prevents the use of "texture packs."
For this reason, the repository is also licensed under any potential future versions of
this license.

The purpose of this license is to describe the license for specific material in this
repository. If not specified it's probably GNU. NOTE: the three license files do not
necessarily describe all the material in this repository. For example, the vendor
subdirectory contains external material that has its own license. In addition there is
code copied for Stack Overflow. (At the time of writing only two copied sections)

This repository includes many works from many others. The authors can only grant rights
they themselves have the right to grand. File formats generally have their own
license. Go check out the JSON license for example.
